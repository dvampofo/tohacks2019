## ABOUT

Torontonians have the 5th most expensive transit pass in the world(!) (CBC News, 2017) and transportation costs make up a significant portion of their budget.

My team developed a prototype tool called PresTO (with Microsoft Azure) that helps transit users calculate the amount of money the rider saves (or loses) when they purchase a monthly transit pass. Future releases include notifying customers of interesting venues along their route.
